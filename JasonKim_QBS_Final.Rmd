## Load Relevant Libraries
```{r libs, echo = T, warning = F}
library(readr)
library(labelled)
library(dplyr)
library(magrittr)
library(ggplot2)
library(scales)
library(gridExtra)
library(SASxport)

library(stringr)
```


## Data Source
The data was downloaded from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey from 2015-2016. In particular, this data set is the 'Weight History Questionnaire' 
(https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/search/datapage.aspx?Component=Questionnaire&CycleBeginYear=2015)

The questions were related to body weight, height, and methods of losing weight. 

The eligible sample for the data was any person in the United States over the age of 16. The data was collected by trained interviewers using Computer Assisted Personal Interview (CAPI). 

The dimensions matches that of a converted csv file, indicating the sasxport.get function worked well.

```{r intro, echo = T, warning = F}
# Read the xpt file using the SASxport library
weight_df <- sasxport.get('/Users/jasonkim/QBS 181 Final/WHQ_I.XPT')

# I removed the labels for the columns because they were lengthy and contained a lot of whitespace
weight_df <- remove_labels(weight_df)
head(weight_df)
dim(weight_df)
```

## Initial Observations

There are many entries that are NaN for a wide variety of the survey questions. The column names are unclear without direct access to the data documentation.
